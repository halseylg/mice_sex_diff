# mice_sex_diff

This repo is for analyising a WT mice data for analysing sex difference over 200 traits. Our intial questions are two-fold: 1) how much sex difference in variability mice have over these 200 traits and 2) Do males and females differ in allometry?

To analyse the data, download the raw data file `dr7.0_all_control_data.csv` and save it in a file in this folder called `data`. This folder is not tracked by git, as it is too large. 

To analyse the data, you'll need to downalod either the raw data or the cleaned data.

See Scripts with analysis results in folder `scripts`

Most up to date script is 2019_4June_IMPC variance and sex difference.Rmd (found in 'scripts')   
Dataset to use is data_clean.rds (in master branch).   
This version runs all the necessary function within the script, so no externally loaded functions necessary    
(please note: some of the original functions have been changed slightly)
